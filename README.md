# Ammuccamu! – UX Project Report

Ammuccamu! is a specialized food delivery application designed exclusively for the city of Catania, Italy. Unlike generic delivery platforms, this app focuses on local culinary traditions, offering specialties such as typical sweets, fresh fish from the local "Pescheria," and Catania's signature horse meat.
In this repo there are 3 files:
- `Wireframe Ammuccamu!.png`: Complete app's wireframe collection.
- `Presentazione _Ammuccamu!_.png`: A Figjam screenshot about the process of creation and wireflow structure.
- `Relazione progetto UX.docx`: A complete documentation about the project, written in italian. 

## Project Overview
The project follows a structured UX design process divided into three fundamental phases:
- `Strategy`: Market analysis and positioning.
- `Definition`: Scope and user stories.
- `Structure`: Information architecture and wireframing for three distinct user types.

## Strategy & Positioning
After analyzing major competitors like Glovo, UberEats, JustEat, and Deliveroo, Ammuccamu! was positioned as a hybrid service:
- `Primary Function`: Home delivery.
- `Specific Operability`: Limited to the territory of Catania, focusing exclusively on local traditional products.

## Key Features
- `Food Catalog`: Searchable menu with filters for local specialties (e.g., fried snacks, horse meat, fish).
- `"Product History"` Section: A storytelling feature where users can learn about the origins and traditions of a dish through text, photos, and videos.
- `Loyalty Stamps`: Users accumulate stamps by ordering from the same restaurant to receive discounts, incentivizing local consumption.
- `Multi-Role Management`: Dedicated interfaces for Customers, Riders, and Business Owners.

## Information Architecture & User Flows
1. User (Customer) Flow
Designed for a seamless ordering experience:
- `Onboarding`: Splash screen with login/registration and error handling (Nielsen’s 9th Heuristic).
- `Exploration`: Homepage with search, filters, and access to the "Product History".
- `Ordering`: Cart management, secure payment (Cash or Card), and real-time order tracking.
- `Loyalty`: A dedicated section to track active discount stamps.


2. Rider Flow
A simplified flow for delivery logistics:
- `Courier Registration`: Two-step process (Progress Bar) collecting personal data and work availability.
- `Earnings Dashboard`: Daily and weekly revenue tracking.
- `Delivery Management`: Real-time delivery status updates using QR code verification for successful deliveries.

3. Business (Restaurateur) Flow
Tools for managing a digital storefront:
- `Menu Management`: Add/remove products and create specific promotions.
- `Storytelling Control`: Upload multimedia content and descriptions for the "Product History" section.
- `Analytics`: View order history, customer feedback, and statistics filtered by date.

## Design & Usability
The wireframes were designed using an iPhone 14 layout. Several Nielsen’s Heuristics were applied to ensure a professional UX:
- `Heuristic #6` (Recognition rather than recall): Use of progress bars during registration to show the user's current step.
- `Heuristic #9` (Error recovery): Pop-up notifications to help users diagnose and solve login or payment failures.
- `Heuristic #10` (Help and documentation): Dedicated "Support" section within the Business profile.

## Tech & Tools
- `Design Platform`: Figma
- `Target Device`: iPhone 14 
- `Methodology`: User-Centered Design (UCD)
